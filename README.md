# Readable App

This app is a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## TL;DR

Instructions for development:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

The backend server that this app will communicate with can be taken from
[`Server-Starter-Kit`] https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter

Set up as following:
1. Download or fork and clone the starter server repository
2. Install the requirements from the included package.json file: npm install
3. cd into api-server and start the server with command - node server

## Important
The server supports a small, fixed number of categories that users can put posts into. The server does not have methods for creating/modifying/deleting these categories. If you wish to add to the categories for your app, simply add your desired object to the Array in categories.js in the provided server.
